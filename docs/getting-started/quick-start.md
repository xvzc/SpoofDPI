# Quick Start

SpoofDPI provides a number of options to customize its behavior, and these options have default values. If it works as expected without customizing the option values, you can just run it as shown below.
```console
$ spoofdpi
```

If you can't get it working as expected, check [User Guide](../user-guide/overview.md) for more information on customization.
